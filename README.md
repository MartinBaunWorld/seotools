# SEO utils

A collection of small SEO utils I use to help me and might help you
Currently, only one but let's see where this goes :)



## sitemap to bing

sitemap2bing.py is a little tool that helps you submit your sitemap to bing.
Bing really likes to receive these submissions and it'll help with ranking higher.

Example usage:

```
python3 sitemap2bing.py YOUR_BING_KEY https://martinbaun.com/sitemap.xml
```
